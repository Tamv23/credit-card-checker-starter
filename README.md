Credit Card Checker (JavaScript)

This project is a **JavaScript practice challenge** from Codecademy that focuses on validating credit card numbers using the **Luhn algorithm**.

The goal was to practice:
- Array manipulation
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Writing reusable functions in JavaScript

---

Project Description

The program checks whether a credit card number is **valid or invalid** based on the Luhn algorithm.  
It can also:

- Identify **invalid credit card numbers**
- Determine **which companies** issued invalid cards
- Convert a **string-based card number** into an array of digits

---

Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)

---

- `findInvalidCards()`  
  Finds all invalid credit cards from a nested array.

- `idInvalidCardCompanies()`  
  Identifies credit card companies that issued invalid cards (no duplicates).

- `stringToArray()`  
  Converts a string credit card number into an array of numbers.
